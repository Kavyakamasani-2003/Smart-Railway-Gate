# Smart Railway Gate System

## Overview
The **Smart Railway Gate System** is designed to automate the operation of railway gates to enhance safety and efficiency. The system uses sensors to detect approaching trains and automatically controls the gate's opening and closing, reducing human intervention and minimizing accidents.

## Features
- **Automated Gate Control:** Uses sensors to detect train movement and operate the gate accordingly.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Provides continuous monitoring of railway tracks to ensure safe crossings.
- **Accident Prevention:** Reduces the chances of accidents by eliminating manual errors.
- **Efficient Traffic Management:** Minimizes waiting time for road vehicles and pedestrians by optimizing gate operation.

## Requirements
To implement the Smart Railway Gate System, the following components and dependencies are required:
- **Hardware:**
  - IR Sensors / Ultrasonic Sensors
  - Arduino / Raspberry Pi
  - Servo Motor for gate movement
  - Buzzer and LED indicators
- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE / Python
  - Libraries for sensor communication
  - Serial communication for real-time data processing
